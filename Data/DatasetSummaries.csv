Developmental Outcome,Description of Dataset
Stunting,"This dataset presents model-based estimates of stunting prevalence among children under 5 years of age, a key indicator of child malnutrition and human development tracked under SDG Target 2.2. Stunting, defined as height-for-age more than two standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards, reflects chronic or recurrent malnutrition and is linked to child mortality, poor physical and cognitive development, and broader inequalities. Estimates are produced through the UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates (JME) using standardized methods, nationally representative surveys, and statistical modelling to generate comparable country, regional, and global trends. Data are updated biennially and disaggregated by sex, age, wealth, maternal education, and residence when available. While based on quality-assured surveys and administrative systems, estimates are subject to uncertainty from sampling and non-sampling errors, with modelling applied to ensure consistent global reporting and comparability across time and countries."
Unemployment,"This dataset provides unemployment statistics, defined as the share of the labor force without work but available for and seeking employment. The unemployment rate is calculated as the number of unemployed persons divided by the total labor force (employed plus unemployed). Data sources include household labor force surveys, population censuses, official estimates, and administrative records, with modeled estimates from the ILO used to fill gaps and ensure regional and global comparability. While modeled data support trend analysis, they carry higher uncertainty and should not be used for country rankings. The dataset is produced by the International Labour Organization (ILOSTAT), aggregated using weighted averages, and made available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license with specific mediation and arbitration provisions. More details and access are available through the World Bank and ILO data portals."
Maternal Mortality,"This dataset provides metadata for the Maternal Mortality Ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births), an official World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) measure (Indicator ID: WB_WDI_SH_STA_MMRT). Produced by the Development Economics Data Group (DECDG) of the World Bank, in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and UNDESA, the indicator tracks the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of termination per 100,000 live births. Estimates cover 1985–2023 and are generated using regression models that incorporate fertility, maternal deaths, skilled birth attendants, and GDP (PPP). The data are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 3.1.1 on maternal health. Maternal mortality remains a major global health challenge, disproportionately affecting women in low- and middle-income countries despite preventable causes and available solutions. The dataset is updated annually, subject to methodological limitations and potential measurement errors, and is licensed under CC BY-4.0. Access is available via the World Bank API in multiple formats (JSON, XML)."
Youth not in Education or Training,"This dataset, produced by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group in collaboration with ILOSTAT, provides annual data on the share of youth (ages 15–24) not in education, employment, or training (NEET) as a percentage of the total youth population. The NEET indicator captures both unemployed youth not in education or training and economically inactive youth outside education or training, making it an important complement to labor force participation and unemployment rates. It is widely used for policy analysis given its relevance to youth unemployment, labor market transitions, and risks of social and economic exclusion. Data are sourced primarily from household-based labor force surveys and follow international standards set by the ILO and the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, though national variations in definitions may affect comparability. The indicator is linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.6, which aims to substantially reduce the NEET rate, and is available from 1970 to 2023 through the World Bank’s World Development Indicators and ILOSTAT platforms under a CC BY-4.0 license."
Youth Literacy Rate,"This dataset provides information on the youth literacy rate, defined as the percentage of people aged 15–24 who can read and write with understanding a short, simple statement about their everyday life. It is identified as WB_HCP_YOUTH_LIT and maintained by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group, drawing on data from the World Development Indicators and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The data covers the period from 1970 to 2023 and includes disaggregation by year, sex, and geographic area (country or region). It is measured as a percentage of youth ages 15–24 and categorized under education and youth topics. The dataset is provided in English under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution International License with detailed provisions for dispute resolution. Updated metadata is reflected in version 1.1 as of March 2025, ensuring consistent title formatting."
Neonatal Mortality Rate,"The dataset “Mortality rate, neonatal (per 1,000 live births)” (WB_HCP_NEOMORT) is produced by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group and provides annual data from 2010 to 2022 on neonatal mortality—the number of deaths within the first 28 days of life per 1,000 live births. Data are sourced from the World Development Indicators, UNICEF, WHO, and the UN Population Division. The dataset covers countries, regions, and years, measured per 1,000 live births, and is part of the World Bank’s Human Capital Project under the prenatal and early childhood health theme. It is available in English and licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), with links to the World Bank data catalog for access and further details."
Still Birth Rates,"The dataset “Stillbirth rate (per 1,000 total births)” (WB_HNP_SH_DYN_STLB) compiled by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group provides annual estimates from 1960 to 2023 on the number of fetal deaths at 28 weeks or more of gestation per 1,000 total births. Developed using data from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, UN DESA), the methodology combines country-level administrative, survey, and study data, applies quality adjustments, and models trends with covariates to fill gaps. The dataset highlights the global health burden of stillbirths—especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia—including psychological, financial, and societal impacts, noting slower progress in reducing stillbirth rates compared to under-5 child mortality. Data are measured per 1,000 total births, updated annually, and provided under a CC BY 4.0 license."
Victims of Intentional Homicides,"The dataset “Intentional Homicides (per 100,000 people)” (WB_WDI_VC_IHR_PSRC_P5) produced by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group provides country-level estimates of unlawful homicides deliberately inflicted by individuals or small groups, excluding deaths from armed conflict. The data, covering 1990–2021, are primarily sourced from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and supplemented by criminal justice and public health records from WHO, PAHO, and other international agencies. It captures patterns and trends in violent crime, including domestic, gang-related, and organized crime homicides, with young males most affected and women disproportionately impacted by intimate partner and family-related violence. The dataset reports official counts without modeling, prioritizing recent data and selecting series considered most reliable. Users should exercise caution when comparing countries due to differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and data coverage. The dataset is available under a CC BY-4.0 license and accessible via the World Bank API in JSON and XML formats."
HIV incidence,"This dataset provides annual estimates of the incidence of HIV, measured as the number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected people, from 1990 to 2022 across countries, regions, and country groups. Produced by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group, the data are primarily modeled using the Spectrum software, incorporating HIV prevalence surveys, populations at higher risk, antiretroviral therapy coverage, and, where available, case reporting and vital registration data. The dataset aims to track progress in preventing HIV transmission, inform public health interventions, and highlight the disproportionate burden of HIV in low- and middle-income countries. It is aggregated as a weighted average and is openly accessible under the CC BY-4.0 license via the World Bank’s WDI API in JSON and XML formats."
Adolescent Pregnancies,"This dataset, produced by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group (DECDG), provides the adolescent fertility rate, defined as the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–19, covering the period 1960–2023. Data are derived from vital registration systems, censuses, or sample surveys, with model-based estimates used where empirical data are unavailable. The indicator is aligned with reproductive health goals and Sustainable Development Goal 3, Target 7, highlighting health risks associated with early childbearing. Data are available annually at country, region, and country-group levels, with sources including the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects. The dataset is provided under a CC BY-4.0 license and accessible via the World Bank API in JSON and XML formats."
Access to Safe Water Services,"This dataset, produced by the World Bank’s Development Economics Data Group in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF, provides the percentage of the population using safely managed drinking water services—defined as water from improved sources that is accessible on premises, available when needed, and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. The data are derived from household surveys, censuses, administrative sources, and international compilations, with estimates generated using the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) methodology. Access to safely managed water is critical for reducing disease, child mortality, and poverty, while improving education, economic productivity, and gender equity, as women and children are often the primary water collectors. The dataset covers countries worldwide from 2000 to 2022, aligns with SDG 6.1 on clean water and sanitation, and is updated biennially with weighted averages, subject to quality checks. Data and metadata are openly accessible under a CC BY-4.0 license via the World Bank and JMP platforms."
